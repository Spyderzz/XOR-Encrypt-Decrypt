# XOR-Encrypt-Decrypt
NodeJS Code for XOR Encryption &amp; Decryption

In cryptography, the simple XOR cipher is a type of additive cipher,an encryption algorithm that operates according to the principles:

A⊕0 = A

A⊕A = 0

A⊕B = B⊕A

(A⊕B)⊕C = A⊕(B⊕C)

(B⊕A)⊕A = B⊕0 = B

⊕ denotes the exclusive disjunction (XOR) operation.

I used a Random GUID as the Key for XOR.
Encrypts the data to HEX Format which is further encoded as BASE64 in final Output.
